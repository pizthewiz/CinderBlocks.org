### INTERN
- do something with forks

### WEB
- use gulp-awspublish-router to more closely control AWS publishing
- load only the images that are visible in the scroll region?
- create placeholder favicon.ico and apple-touch-icon
- use anchor to indicate sort and base filter
- offer on-page search, again dump into anchor
- style the page
- fallback block image and colors
- analytics? [MixPanel's Partner Plan](https://mixpanel.com/free/) or [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com)?
- add 404 and 500 error pages
- add a simple about content with colophon and basic cinderblock info with links
- check out the [angularjs-styleguide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angularjs-styleguide)
- use referrer to limit access to /data/blocks.json

### GENERAL

### LATER
- consider persistant blocks_metadata.json for key-value metadata store
